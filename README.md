This repository contain the algorithms used in my master's thesis related to spatial microsimulation process.

## Data
---
The data used was provided by [2010 Brazilian Census](https://www.ibge.gov.br/estatisticas/sociais/populacao/22827-censo-2020-censo4.html?=&t=downloads).

For the microsimulation process, we need basically three data bases,  all of which are provided by IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics):
- Data from the census sector, which were used as constraints variables;
- Microdata from census;
- A statistical grid with a population count in a 200x200 meter grid.
